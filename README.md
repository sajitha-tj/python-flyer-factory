# Python Flyer Factory

This repository contains several python scripts which generate flyers for events. The flyers are manipulated using the `pillow` library. These scripts are used by the [Moraspirit](https://www.moraspirit.com) during the SLUG XIV season (2023) to generate flyers for their events. All assets including logos and fonts are included in each directory.

## How to use

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Read the documentation in each directory to understand how to use the scripts

## Special Thanks

Several designers have contributed to this repository by creating amazing flyers. Special thanks to them for their hard work.
