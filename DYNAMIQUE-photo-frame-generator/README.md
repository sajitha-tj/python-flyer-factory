# Dynamique Photo frame generator

## Description

"Dynamique" is a photography competition held by MoraSpirit in 2023 parallel to SLUG XIV event. This python script will generate a flyer that will be published through the official facebook page of MoraSpirit. Flyer will contain the photos that are submitted to the competition including name and university of the photographer. A python script was used to simplify the process of generating the flyer since there are a large number of photos submitted.

## How to use

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Add the photos to the `photos` folder. Make sure to rename the photos as `number - name - university.jpg` (eg: `DYN001 - John Doe - UOM.jpg`)
4. Run the `main.py` file
5. The generated flyer will be saved in the `output` folder
